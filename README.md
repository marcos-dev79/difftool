## Be Coding Challenge

### Solution description

In my presented solution for this DiffTool I used springboot to make the presentation more concise and
easy to run. I used the springboot framework to create a rest api that receives a request
and process the Class.

Just run the App and type

http://localhost:8080/diff-rest/diff

in your browser.

I though about using recursion and create a more complex and robust solution, however 
I run of time and I decided to use a simple solution.

I look forward for hearing your critics. Thank you for the opportunity.

### Time consumed
I took a few hours to bring up this solutions, 4h to be more precise.
